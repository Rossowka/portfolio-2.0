            <CaseStudyParagraph>
              I began by conducting interviews with our internal specialists to map out how
              engineers design manifolds. Their main painpoints were repetitive tasks and manual
              calculations eating their time. I drafted a flow that would digitilize the process and
              built a simple prototype to present to our SMEs and check if we found a common
              understanding.
            </CaseStudyParagraph>
            {/* add an image of the mapped out process */}

            <HeadingM headingText="Pivoting to reality" />
            <CaseStudyParagraph>
              After multiple rounds of iterations we landed on a product that stakeholders were
              happy about. I presented the prototype to our external development team and that's
              when we hit a wall. We had only 4 months to develop the app, and the development
              flagged it as too big of a scope to be able to make it in time.
              <br />
              <br />
              Due to limited resources, product team made a decision it won't be a standalone app,
              as it was initially planned. The tool had to live inside Product Finder, which meant
              for me, that functionality and design had to be radically simplified. I proposed we
              split the project into two: deliver Cartridge Selection Tool now, and postpone
              Manifold Configurator for later.
            </CaseStudyParagraph>
            {/* comparison image of the original design and what we landed on. trade-offs

            <HeadingM headingText="Workshop that unlocked development" />
            <CaseStudyParagraph>
              With a split product, we needed to reframe what our product vision was. I facilitated
              an MVP prioritization workshop using the MoSCoW method, categorizing features into
              must-haves, should-haves, could-haves, and won't-haves, focused on separating the 2
              products. This session became our north star when making trade-offs later.

            {/* add image that says this:
            Key must-haves we identified:
